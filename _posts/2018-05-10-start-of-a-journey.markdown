One of my university professors taught me that we are hunter gatherers by nature and has never changed throughout the history of mankind. To accomplish any task is the acquision of the right amount of tools, resources, and knowledge to achieve your goals regardless if its odd or not.

Kanban combined with Agile is one tool I respect. From my previous job, Kanban with Agile has been a game changer in how we worked as a team (Thank you Shalaka Tendulkar. I’ll make sure to limit the shout-outs. However, too many people have aided me in my journey. I definitely stand on the shoulders of giants). It may not be not perfect (and definitely it is hard to execute). However, it is definitely better than a huge to do list. Although the concepts of Kanban with Agile is mainly used in software development and information technology industry, I find that the habits and rituals that is in Kanban has been emensely positive for someone who needs to practice structure and focus.

Knowing myself, I definitely need this especially in our competitive marketplace where I am looking for clients and work. Therefore, I am going to be trying a personal version of Kanban and agile for myself.

In the following weeks, I shall be cataloguing and journaling my experiences and deployment in this small little experiment. To be honest, I have no idea if this is going to work and have value. It’s definitely be written in a very gonzo-like experience. Nevertheless, like previously said, I assert that should at least be better than having a big todo list.

But before I begin, there are definitely many modifications to how Kanban and Agile is usually deployed. Here are some philosophical tips and rules I enforce myself in deploying my own personal Kanban workflow. There are a random selection tibids of wisdom that has in previous experience has helped me a lot that would be my approach to this journey:

### 1. Aim for consistency. It does not need to be perfect. However, it needs to work for you in a consistent way.

Perfection is a costly item. Sometimes we pay the high cost to aim what’s perfect with little payback. The reality is that what we should really aim is a balance of the ideal and what’s pragmatic. This task in itself is incredibly hard to execute. However, the ideal is a crucial goal to achieve. Never back down in the face of failure and submit to failure.

### 2. Be honest with yourself.

Due to the nature of our humanity, I find this to be both the easiest to agree and understand and the hardest thing to actually do. However, I believe that being honest with yourself is a crucial element of success. Any tools is as powerful as the governance of the user. Not being honest is only just buying a horrible blowback that shall be paid later.

### 3. Find a voltron of mentors to check yourself.

I like to imagine this as the contingency plan of the previous step. There’s a small little bible verse I know that I think is applicable to anybody: “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?” We ourselves are our worst enemy.

Many times in our career we have always been searching for the perfect sage or mentor. I find this search to be highly costly as it is difficult to find someone with the capacity of time and resources (not to mention interest in oneself) to fulfill that role. Finding a mixture of people you respect is a good way to create a network of accountability. I call this assembling your own voltron of mentors and people you respect.

Individually they cover an area of development and when they are formed together becomes an abstract sense of that one individual mentor. Equally, you can become a piece of someone else’s voltron mentor. We all share a piece of the impact in the communities that we are in.

Stay tuned for the next post. I shall be showing an example of the back log I have and the process in how I would tackle the backlog. I hope to explore this both in a practical and philosophical way. I’m sorry I’m not able to write any practical items. However, I find this to be a good starting point. I assure you the next post shall have practical elements to what I am saying!

Feel free to leave comments! I am always trying to improve my thoughts and my writing. Thank you for your time.
